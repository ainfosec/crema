{"name":"Crema","tagline":"Crema: A Sub-Turing Programming Language","body":"## Introduction\r\nCrema is a LLVM front-end that aims to specifically execute in sub-Turing Complete space.\r\nDesigned to be simple to learn, and practical for the majority of programming tasks needed,\r\nCrema can restrict the computational complexity of the program to the minimum needed to improve\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\nCrema is developed in C++ in order to natively utilize the LLVM tool-chain and integrate with\r\nflex/bison to simplify parser generation.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nStart off by cloning the latest version of Crema from this git repository\r\n\r\n### Building the Crema Tool\r\nBefore building the Crema tool, make sure that you have the following dependencies installed on your environment:\r\n\r\n1. g++\r\n2. bison: \t\thttp://www.gnu.org/software/bison/\r\n3. llvm-dev\r\n4. flex:\t\thttp:(C) 2014-2015 Assured Information Security, Inc.//flex.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nBuild the Crema tool by running ```make``` in the src directory. This will create the \"cremacc\" program. You can clean the src directory by running ```make clean```\r\n\r\n### Compiling your Crema programs with cremacc\r\nTo compile a Crema program into LLVM IR for JIT execution, simply use the \"cremacc\" program.\r\n\r\nCrema files use the extention \".crema\". To build a crema file into an executable named \"program.exe\", use the command:\r\n```\r\n./cremacc -f <path-to-a-crema-file> -o program\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo print LLVM assembly to a fi(C) 2014-2015 Assured Information Security, Inc.le, use the -S option:\r\n``` ./cremacc -f <path-to-a-crema-file> -S <output-file-name>.ll```\r\n\r\nFor help with all of the other command line options available for cremacc, simply run:\r\n```./cremacc -h```\r\n\r\n## Learning Crema\r\nUse the [Wiki](https://github.com/ainfosec/crema/wiki) to get started with code examples, reference information, and other general topics about the Crema language.\r\n\r\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for Public Release, Distribution Unlimited)\r\n\r\n(C) 2014-2015 Assured Information Security, Inc.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
